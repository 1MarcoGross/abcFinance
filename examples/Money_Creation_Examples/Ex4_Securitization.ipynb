    "This notebook demonstrates how securitization contributes to the desctruction of total money stocks.\n",

    "We start by importing required utilities. Technical notes: the code assumes that the notebook is saved in the money creation examples folder, if you wish to save it in a different folder modify the path below accordingly (if you wish to execute or modify the code herein, it can be viewed without that). Furthermore, the cells containing booking statements should only be executed once, because the booking statements will be recorded on each execution, which may result in assertion errors, e.g. when more cash is deducted than the agent possesses. If you wish to execute the booking statements again, then all cells starting from the declaration of the agents should be executed again, in order to reset the system and repeat the sequence of booking statements."
